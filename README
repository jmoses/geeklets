These are the script that back some geeklets that I use with Geektool.

== weather_icon

Grab the current weather icon from Yahoo and save it to a file in the temp directory.

Prints the current temperature to STDOUT, so you can use this as the temp source, and it will
update the image for you at the same time.  No cron job needed.

== twitter_timeline

Prints the last 10 tweets in your timeline.

You'll need to jack with OAUTH to make this work.

Create a $HOME/.twitter file, and put this in it:

    ---
    token: 1RYvhrmfRNWMxAQ8ViI1Bg
    secret: Q5FvdrkkX6HWfpffg4nc6cvIBFEmR6BPWaOY3ODY
    
Then run the script in a console.  Enter your pin, and then you're set.

== last.fm-parser

Pulls the last 10 recently played tracks from a last.fm account, and formats them nicely.
